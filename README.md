With more than 5 years of experience, I am a full stack developer, passionate about technology and art in all its forms. I specialize in front end with React, React Native and Typescript. I have knowledge of UX, Next js, Nest js, Mongo, AWS, Docker and testing. I am also a release manager; I am in charge of deploying applications for Android and iOS.

I enjoy the challenges that allow me to acquire new skills and knowledge, which is why I am focused on continuing my training and searching for personal and professional growth to contribute to the success of a company. I am characterized by my ambition, teamwork, persistence and commitment to the use of good practices.
